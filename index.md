# Introduction to the HARC Project

The [Pervasive Technology Institute at Indiana University](https://pti.iu.edu/) (PTI@IU) conducted a project—Humans Advancing Research in the Cloud (HARC)—to explore, advance, and develop evidence of how human resources support and increase the use of cloud-based cyberinfrastructure (CI) by researchers in university environments in North America.  HARC explores the critical importance of people in the provision of CI—beyond just hardware, software, and advanced networks components—that supports research in the 21st century. This concept is based on decades of experience and success in broad areas of leveraging IT support resources, as use of technology became decentralized and distributed starting in the 1990s. The concept was first described in the [2011 NSF Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure Task Force on Campus Bridging](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/oac/taskforces/TaskForceReport_CampusBridging.pdf).  HARC provides focus on the work of those who serve in support roles, enabling the use of cloud-based CI in research.  Key outcomes include producing contributions to the academic record (e.g., papers and presentations) and the development of resources (e.g., training and tools) for the community.
